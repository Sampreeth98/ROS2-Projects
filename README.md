# ROS2 Robotics Projects Repository

A collection of diverse projects showcasing the capabilities of ROS2 in various robotic applications. Each project highlights different aspects of ROS2 functionality and integration with other technologies.

## Projects Overview:

1. **Simple ROS2 Programs:**
   - Simple programs demonstrating the usage of basic ROS2 concepts such as publisher, subscriber, server, service, action, and client interfaces.

2. **Gotta Catch em all : Turtle Spawner and Catching:**
   - Implementation of a Random Spawner within Turtlesim to spawn turtles at random positions. The main turtle's task is to catch them using a control loop.

3. **Arm - Manipulator Control with Computer Vision:**
   - Integration of robotic arm manipulator with Gazebo RViz2 and MoveIt for object manipulation tasks using computer vision techniques like inverse kinematic approximation.

4. **Alexa-controlled Robotic Arm:**
   - Controlling a robotic arm using Alexa voice commands for enhanced accessibility and user interaction.

5. **Object Tracking with End Effector Camera:**
   - Ongoing project focusing on utilizing an end effector-mounted camera for object detection and implementing real-time tracking using high-speed YOLO to minimize processing delays.
